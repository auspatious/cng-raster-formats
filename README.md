## Getting Started

The interesting contents of this repo are, primarily, the Jupyter notebooks in
the [`./notebooks`](./notebooks) directory. To facilitate easily running the
notebooks in a properly-initialized environment, a docker compose file is
provided. The project can also be run in a GitHub codespace without having to
run anything locally. Alternately, one can set up their own python environment
and run Jupyter without a dependency on docker.

Docker compose is the recommended approach if wanting to keep all services
local (due to bad internet and/or concerns about leveraging GitHub serivces).
GitHub codespaces are recommended if considering ease of use alone.

### Running locally without docker (least recommended approach)

This approach is not recommended as it is more subject to local environment
differences than the docker-based approaches. But it does have the benefit of
not requiring docker as a dependency.

Note that the instructions below were written with a MacOS/Linux environment in
mind. Windows users will likely need to leverage something like [git for
Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and the included Git BASH tool to follow
along (WSL is also likely a viable solution to get a Linux environment on a
Windows machine).

To get started, clone this repository and set up a python venv. Python >=3.12
is recommended:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/jkeifer/cng-raster-formats.git
cd cng-raster-formats
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

With the activated virtual environment, install the required python dependencies:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Doing so will install Jupyter, which can then be started by running the
following command:

```commandline
jupyter lab
```

Jupyter should automatically launch the JupyterLab interface in a web browser
with this project loaded. Select a notebook from the `notebooks` directory and
work through it.

### Running locally with docker (recommended for local executions)

Using docker has the advantage of better constraining the execution
environment, which is also set up automatically with the required dependencies.

Note that the instructions below were written with a MacOS/Linux environment in
mind. Windows users will likely need to leverage WSL to access a Linux
environment to run docker.

To begin, clone this repo:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/jkeifer/cng-raster-formats.git
cd cng-raster-formats
```

Ensure the docker daemon or an equivalent is running via whatever mechanism is
preferred (on Linux via the docker daemon or podman; on MacOS via Docker
Desktop, colima, podman, OrbStack, or others), then use `docker compose` to
`up` the project:

```commandline
docker compose up
```

This will start up the Jupyter container within docker in the foreground. If
preferring to run compose in the background, add the detach option to the
compose command via the `-d` flag.

JupyterLab will be started with no authentication, running on port 8888 (by
default; use the env var `JUPYTER_PORT` to change it if that port is already
taken on your machine). Open a web browser and browse to
[`http://127.0.0.1:8888`](http://127.0.0.1:8888) to open the JupterLab
interface. Select a notebook from the `notebooks` directory and work through
it.

### Running in GitHub Codespaces (recommended as easiest approach)

This method is also recommended because it does not require any user
configuration to get up and running. However, it does depend on an external,
web-based service, which may not be ideal in environments with unknown internet
quality (i.e., FOSS4G). This said, it does not require the user to run anything
locally beyond a web browser, which may be necessary for users with Windows or
administratively locked-down machines.

To use GitHub Codespaces, browse to [the project repo in
Github](https://github.com/jkeifer/cng-raster-formats). There, click the green
`<> Code` dropdown button, select the `Codespaces` tab in the dropdown menu,
then click the button to add a new codespace from the `main` branch.

Once the codespace is fully started, go back into the codespaces dropdown menu
on the project repo page (you will likely need to refresh the page). You should
see the codespace listed, and a button with three dots `...` next to it. Click
that button to open a menu with more actions for the codespace, then select
"Open in JupyterLab". Select a notebook from the `notebooks` directory and work
through it.

> [!WARNING]
> Be sure to stop the codespace when not actively working in it to prevent usage
> time accruing while the environment is idle.
>
> GitHub only includes a small number of hours per user per month for free (as
> of time of writing this is 60 hours of runtime for the basic 2-code
> instance).  Running out of that free usage time allowance could result in
> Codespaces being unavailable until the next month or being billed for usage
> charges.
